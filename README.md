## Setup
Unity3D 2019.4.4f1 was used to create this project.


## Adding-Levels
Open the scene at /Asset/Scenes/TestLevel/ and then save it as a new scene in a new folder in the Asset/Scenes/[Make new folder here]/ directory and use it as a fresh slate.

## Adding-Enemies
Drag the prefab /Assets/Resources/Enemies/BoxSoldier into the scene and then drag it into the /Assets/Resources/Enemies/ folder as an original prefab. Rename it and change the paramaters as you please. To change the visuals open the prefab and ONLY change the Mesh transform of the prefab.

## Adding-Turrets
Drag the prefab /Assets/Resources/Buildables/Turret_Basic into the scene and then drag it into the /Assets/Resources/Buildables/ folder as an original prefab. Rename it and change the paramaters as you please. To change the visuals open the prefab and ONLY change the base, Cylinder, Barrel and turretBox.
